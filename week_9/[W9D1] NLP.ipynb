Jake constantly worries about Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about   Tony Janiro  Tony Janiro  , Jake\\'s opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local   Mob boss  Mob boss  , Tommy Como (  Nicholas Colasanto  Nicholas Colasanto  ), and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the   Copacabana  Copacabana  , he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against   Billy Fox  Billy Fox  , after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against   Marcel Cerdan  Marcel Cerdan  .  \\n  A year later, Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie. Jake then asks if Joey had an affair with her; Joey refuses to answer, insults Jake, and leaves. Jake directly asks Vickie about the affair, and when she hides from him in the bathroom, he breaks down the door, prompting her to sarcastically state that she had sex with the entire neighborhood (including his brother, Salvy, and Tommy Como). Jake angrily walks to Joey\\'s house, with Vickie following him, and assaults Joey in front of his wife and children. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen round bout against Laurent Dauthuille in 1950,[2] he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake says nothing and hangs up. Estranged from Joey, Jake\\'s career begins to decline slowly and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.[3]  A year later, Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie.
